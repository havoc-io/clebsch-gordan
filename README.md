# clebsch-gordan

A python-based Clebsch-Gordan Coefficient calculator.  This code is from my
much younger days, one of my first forays into Python back in the 2.3 days, so
it is ridiculously long in the tooth.  Nevertheless, it gets the job done.

More information [here](https://havoc.io/post/clebschgordan/).


## Requirements

- Python (any within the last decade should be good)
- PIL (or Pillow)


## TODO:

- Completely refactor code
- Update command line interface to use the argparse module
